All spacecraft generate and carry contaminant, i.e. unwanted material that may impact mission engineering and science objectives. At NASA,the spacecraft engineering disciplines of planetary protection (PP) and contamination control (CC) are each concerned with the identification, mitigation, and effective control of contaminant. PP interests include preventing ‘forward’ transport of terrestrial biological contaminant – e.g. microbes, spores, and inert particles loaded with these – to solar system bodies; preventing ‘backward’ transport of extraterrestrial contaminant to Earth; and controlling molecular contamination that could make biosignature detection ambiguous in in situ measurements or returned samples. CC is concerned with preventing degradation of spacecraft hardware, instrumentation, and scientific targets by any type of contaminant – molecular or particulate; self-induced or environmental; biologically active or inert. An area of shared interest between PP and CC disciplines is the preservation of special regions and sampling sites of high scientific value from inadvertent contamination by spacecraft. As an example, vehicles that would operate above or land onto bodies with near-vacuum surface conditions, like Earth’s Moon, 1)generate plume effluents during deorbit, descent and landing operations; 2) release molecular contaminants as their materials outgas under vacuum exposure; 3)release molecular and droplet contaminant as they vent their propulsion and / or life support systems; and 4)may also disperse particles of terrestrial origin, including biological contaminant, under vibrational or plume-induced loads. Recent multidisciplinary work at JPL includes the development of models for these processes and affirms that long-distance (i.e. global) transport vectors for both molecular and particulate contaminant exist in nominal spacecraft operation above, and landings onto, ‘airless’ bodies including Earth’s Moon and icy moons (Europa and Enceladus).
