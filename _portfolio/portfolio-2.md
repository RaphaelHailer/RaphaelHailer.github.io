Abstract:
In this study, we are interested in characterizing the mechanical response of the
316L stainless steel through the use of finite elements method, using the Chaboche
constitutive model with a variety of parameter sets. An optimization of the model
parameters is conducted using the NSGA-II evolutionary algorithm, in order to
seek a model that can accurately capture the deformation of full-scale specimens
under cyclic loading with different strain amplitudes. The main objective is to
contribute to the European INCEFA-SCALE project, proposing a framework that
can be replicated by other members to enhance the numerical models of the 316L
steel, allowing for better fatigue life predictions and failure assessment.
