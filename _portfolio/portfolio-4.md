Abstract:
In this present work we are interested in characterizing a porous material mechanical properties by using the PuMA software, developed at NASA. An uncertainty quantification analysis will be conducted in order to provide more reliable results for future experimentalists. More precisely, the main objective of the uncertainty quantification analysis is to formally define the problem under an optimization under uncertainty framework and use the correct mathematical tools to determine the necessary size of the sample’s physical domain captured in the Xray microtomography, in order to capture the macroscopic features of the material using a microscopic domain. The domain sought is called the representative elementary volume, and determining it is crucial for obtaining trustful results from experimental data, while reducing the need for a high number of samples to validate the experimental campaign, thus saving money and time. This work is a proof of concept, and its main purpose is to provide a guideline for future research on the topic of porous materials characterization for thermal protection systems used in space applications.

Keywords: Uncertainty quantification, Gaussian process, Carbon/Phenolic ablators, Thermal protection systems, Porous materials, Microstructure, Thermal conductivity, Representative elementary volume, PuMA, Porous microstructure analysis, Optimization, Surrogate model, Robustness and reliability.
