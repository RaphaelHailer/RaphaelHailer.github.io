Abstract:
The present research presents the development of a Python-based free molecular
Monte Carlo solver for the quantification and characterization of lunar contamination
caused by spacecraft vents. The primary objective of this work is to build a
framework that couples near vehicle Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) simulations
with a long range transport solver, in order to implement in future missions
to atmosphere-free bodies such as Earth’s moon, Jupiter’s moon Europa, Saturn’s
moon Enceladus, among others. The solver counts with the implementation of a 4th
order Runge Kutta integrator (RK4) for solving the system of differential equations
governing the motion of individual particles, which represents various contaminant
molecules. For thus study, water is selected as the contaminant of interest, and
the celestial body considered is Earth’s moon. Additionally, two particle loss mechanisms
are implemented: (1) Permanently Shadowed Regions (PSRs), acting as
thermal traps, and (2) particle loss due to velocities exceeding the scape velocity
of the celestial body. The results from the current model provide insights into
the general behavior of contaminant transport on the lunar surface, with potential
applications for planetary protection missions in the future.
