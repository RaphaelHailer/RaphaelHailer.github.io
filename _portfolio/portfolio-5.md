During my time at Antares, I worked in multiple areas, as the team was fairly small by the time. I was leader of the aerodynamics and structures, thus responsible for 
managing the department members activities, selecting materials for a diverse range of components (fuselage, nose cone, engine, bulkheads etc.) and planning the entire
distribution of subcomponents in the rockets. In addition, I was responsible for all rocket projects of the team.

During my time at Antares, I won the second and third place awards in the Latin American Space Challenge (LASC) 2020 and 2021, respectively. The rocket projects were the
500 meters apogee rockets Anhang√°, which was the first rocket ever developed by the team, and the 1000 meters apogee rocket Aurora.

Moreover, I was also heavily involved in the manufacturing of the rocket engines at the time, and even received funding from the Brazilian Space Agency (AEB) through the
FUNCATE program to develop a test base for solid rocket engines.
