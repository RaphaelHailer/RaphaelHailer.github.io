Abstract: 
In the present work, we delve into the application of the Polynomial Chaos Expansion (PCE) 
method for undertaking uncertainty quantification in stochastic Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD)
simulations. These simulations are performed using OpenFOAM, a comprehensive open-source solver. 
The study specifically concentrates on two well established benchmark problems within the CFD 
domain: the lid-driven cavity problem and the dynamic airflow analysis around a NACA0012 airfoil. 
Both problems were chosen due to the amount of available literature for results comparison and 
discussion. By integrating the PCE method into stochastic CFD analyses, we aim to showcase its 
effectiveness as an uncertainty quantification tool. This approach stands out for its potential 
to bypass the high computational costs associated with traditional Monte Carlo methods in 
statistical evaluations.

Keywords: Uncertainty quantification, Surrogate model, Predictive model, Polynomial chaos, 
Stochastic, CFD, OpenFOAM, Full-Order model, NACA0012, Lid-driven cavity problem.
